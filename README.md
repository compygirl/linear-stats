# Linear-stats
* `ayessenb` 


## Algorithms project in go lang testing period

I created the program which receives a data from data.txt file which should be provided in the list of arguments. 

* go.mod - defines a module, which is a collection of Go packages. It contains the data about the module, such as its name, version, and dependencies on other modules. (not using extra packages)
* go.sum - contain a list of all the downloaded modules, their versions, and their hash.
* main.go - go-reloaded main function which executes all the functions related to all list of modifications.

#### Functions:


* Average 

* Median

* Variance 

* Standard Deviation

* Linear Regression
* Pearson Correlation Coefficent


#### Improved skills:
* go lang programming skills 
* usage of math, strconv, sort libraries of Go
* also the regula expresions for validation of the data

## Usage/Examples
Cloning storage to your host
```CMD/Terminal 
git clone git@git.01.alem.school:ayessenb/linear-stats.git
```

Go to the downloaded repository:

```CMD/Terminal 
cd linear-stats
```
Run a program:
```CMD/Terminal 
go run main.go data.txt
```
Output:
```
Linear Regression Line: y = -8.742857x + 153.857143
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: -0.5330331012
```
